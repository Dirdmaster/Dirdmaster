## Origin

The coffee is a blend of green coffees from three regions of Guatemala:

- New Oriente
- Cob√°n
- Huehuetenango.

They come from an altitude of approximately 1,500 metres and therefore have the highest quality rating "Strictly Hard
Bean".

### Environement

The soil is volcanic; together with the climate in the region and the high standards in the processing of the coffee,
this results in a high-quality coffee which is very popular with lovers for its balanced taste.

### Background

The beans come from several small farms of the Fedeconcagua cooperative. This was one of the first cooperatives
worldwide to produce fair-trade-certified coffee. Fedecocagua helps its members to improve the quality and production of
coffee and achieve higher prices so that the farming families can earn more money and improve their living conditions!

They also represent the rights of small farmers and support education, medicine and opportunities for the women of the
Mayan families.

## Kev's Recommendation

This variety is perfect as a cappuccino. The nutty notes are strongly enhanced by the milk. Very pleasant (the comfort
drink by excellence)
